  + [executables](https://github.com/rg-1708/Luxonis-Test)

1. Run the client, (the server should be running) <br/>
   ```
   ts-node client.ts
   ```
   Or
   ```
    node client.js
   ```
3. When connected to server, you'll be asked to provide a password,<br/>
   `password is: 1234.`

4. After entering the password, you'll have three options, they'll be also displayed in the terminal.
5. If you provide 0, you'll see the list of possible opponents, if there are none, you'll be notified respectfully.
6. You'll need to copy an id of opponent, then enter 1, to request a match.<br/>
`Afterwards, you'll need to paste id and type in your word.`
7. then the match will start, and two players can start to give hints, and guesses.
8. Then if the opponent gives up, both users will be returned to the menu.<br/>
`If the opponent guesses the word, they will be notified, and then returned to menu.`

### Thank you once again for your time, and consideration!
#### Kind Regards,
#### Ramil Gojayev.
